# This test verifies a scenario where buffer pool chunks
# are not aligned at InnoDB page sizes, which means they
# can contain one fewer page than requested. This also means
# that it's not reliably possible to resize it back to the
# original value. In that case, it ends up having a smaller
# buffer pool than requested due to the mismatched alignment
# of the chunks.
#
# So instead we here restart so we get the original values again.
